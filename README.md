# FaceDetectionDotNet
A small Dlib-based library to detect faces & landmarks + an example app.
Big shout-out to Mark Farragher for [this blog post](https://medium.com/machinelearningadvantage/detect-faces-with-c-and-dlib-in-only-40-lines-of-code-f0bb1b929133), upon which this repo is built.

## Requirements
[DlibDotNet](https://github.com/takuya-takeuchi/DlibDotNet) (you can find it on NuGet).

## Limitations
This code is supposed to deal with frontal faces.
